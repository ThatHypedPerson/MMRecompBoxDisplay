# Majora's Mask: Recompiled Randomizer Chest Display

## Info
This is a simple mod that displays every chest texture currently used in the [Majora's Mask: Recompiled Archipelago Randomizer](https://github.com/RecompRando/MMRecompRando).

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ThatHypedPerson/MMRecompBoxDisplay/releases/latest) of this mod and place it into the Zelda64Recomp mods folder.
> This mod is incompatible with the actual randomizer mod, so make sure to remove it before using this.

## Usage
To use this mod, press `L` near any chest to change its textures. If using a debug build of Zelda64Recomp, then the currently displayed chest will also appear in its console.

## Notes (Textures)
All of the original textures used (in PNG format) can be found in the [textures folder](/textures/) of this repository. They are all applied as `RGBA16` in-game.
<br><br>
That folder is split into textures used by the [OoTMM Randomizer](https://github.com/OoTMM/OoTMM) ([link to original textures](https://github.com/OoTMM/OoTMM/tree/master/packages/core/data/assets/chests)) and [textures created by myself](/textures/archipelago/).
<br><br>
Not every texture found in the [OoTMM directory](/textures/ootmm/) are currently used within the randomizer, so they are not displayed. This mod can be updated to display them if needed.
<br><br>
All of the custom Archipelago chests use a slightly altered model than normal chests. This means there is a texture assigned to both sides of the front rather than a mirrored texture. The "Junk" chest also uses a different "blank" texture for its lid, which uses the wooden chest model rather than the ornate that the other chests use.
<br><br>
The custom Archipelago chests are edits of the original chest textures. The "Junk" chest is simply the original chest with filters applied, and the "Progressive" and "Useful" chests are edits of the Ornate textures.
